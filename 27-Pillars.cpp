// 27 - Pillars (CodeWars Exercise)

/* 

There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. 
Your function accepts three arguments:

1.) number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
2.) distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
3.) width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).
